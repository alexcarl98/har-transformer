# HAR Classification Report

## Step 1
I wanted to do a transformer model so I took these steps:
- I first tried a LabelEncoder rather than a OneHotEncoder
- I First focused on the waist acceleration

### Exercise 1
- instead of ankle data, I tried waist data

## Analyzing Activity Patterns
TODO: Finish this analysis
Take some time to carefully examine the plot generated by the code. Pay attention to the distinct patterns visible for each activity:

1. How do different types of activities look visually in the acceleration data?
    - Waist data has a more constant rhythm for all
    - Ankle and wrist data is more pronounced for things like going upstairs or downstairs 
2. Compare jogging to walking - what differences do you notice in amplitude, frequency, and pattern?
    - Jogging has a larger amplitude and higher frequency compared to walking
3. Look at the different types of walking (treadmill walking vs. sidewalk walking) - can you spot any differences?
    - 
4. Which activities appear most similar to each other? Which are most distinct?
    - The walking activities appear similar in general

## Exercise 2: Try a different classifier
I did an SVM Model at first which did worse in terms of accuracy.
- random forest accuracy: 53%
- SVM accuracy: 48%


### Reflection on Initial Results

Before proceeding to more advanced techniques, consider these questions about our basic model:

1. What does a 50% accuracy tell us about using raw accelerometer data for activity recognition?
- 50% accuracy indicates that the model predicts correctly half of the time.
- If this were a binary classification problem, an accuracy lower than 50% would be worse than random guessing 
- Since this a multi-classification problem, random guessing would return an accuracy of about 16.7%

2. Looking at the confusion matrix, which activities are most commonly confused with each other? Why might this be happening?
- All of the walking activities appear most similar to eachother as they are often confused for one another.
- The jogging treadmill acitivity appears most distinct

3. Our model is only slightly better than random guessing for 6 classes. What limitations of using raw accelerometer values might explain this performance?
- There are architectural limitations as well as hardware limitations present.
- The architecture of random forest and SVM is less advanced than existing time series informed models.


4. What specific aspects of human movements might not be captured when using only the direct x, y, z acceleration values from the waist sensor?
- the temporal aspect of this suffers heavily, you miss how these values change over time.

Take a moment to record your hypotheses - after implementing feature extraction, we'll see if your predictions about potential improvements were correct.

Hypothesis: feature extraction will improve model performance.
