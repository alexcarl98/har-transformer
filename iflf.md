Yes — you’re **on the right track**, and your confusion is totally valid. Let's break this down **precisely for your case**: using **two separate datasets**, both multi-user, multi-sensor, with **the same 4 activities**.

---

## 🔁 The IFLF Perspective (In Practice)

### Let's say:

* **Dataset A** = source domain (e.g., a group of people with wrist sensors)
* **Dataset B** = target domain (e.g., different people with ankle sensors)

---

## ✅ IFLF Strategy

1. **Train a full model on Dataset A**:

   * A **shared feature extractor** (like a CNN or transformer)
   * A **classifier head** (4-class activity classifier)

2. Once trained on A:

   * **Freeze the feature extractor** 🧊
   * **Throw away the classifier head** from A

3. Now train a **new classifier head** using **Dataset B**, keeping the extractor frozen:

   * This new head adapts to **how Dataset B expresses the same 4 activities**

---

## 🤔 Why This Works:

* The frozen feature extractor has learned **invariant movement patterns** like:

  * Acceleration curves
  * Frequency of steps
  * Movement onset
* Even if users or sensors change in Dataset B, those **core patterns are shared**
* You only need a **new lightweight classifier** to map those patterns to the correct activity labels in the new domain

---

## 🚫 What You're Not Doing:

* You're **not training a separate model per activity**
* You're **not retraining the whole model on B** like in MAML
* You're **not assuming B must be similar in scale or class balance to A**

---

## 🧠 TL;DR for Your Setup:

> Yes — you train on Dataset A, freeze the feature extractor, and **only fine-tune the classifier head** on Dataset B. That’s exactly the spirit of IFLF.
